# Spam Mail Classifier — NLP & Machine Learning Project

**Role:** Data Scientist (Individual Project)  
**Objective:** Build a text classification model to detect spam vs. ham (legitimate) emails using NLP and ML techniques.

## 📦 Project Contents
- `Spam_Mail_Classifier.ipynb` — End‑to‑end notebook with preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.  
- `requirements.txt` — Reproducible environment.  
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` — Clean, recruiter‑ready setup.  

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Spam mails are a major issue in communication systems. This project aims to automate spam detection by training a classifier on a labeled dataset of emails.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit‑learn, NLTK, Jupyter Notebook.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning** — handled missing values, standardized text.  
2. **Text Preprocessing** — tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.  
3. **Feature Engineering** — TF‑IDF vectorization of email text.  
4. **Modeling** — trained Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and ensemble classifiers.  
5. **Evaluation** — compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score.  

## 📈 Outcomes
- Achieved strong performance with **Naive Bayes classifier** for spam detection.  
- Demonstrated text preprocessing & feature extraction for NLP tasks.  
- Delivered interpretable model with practical business value in email filtering.  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
# then open: Spam_Mail_Classifier.ipynb
```
